- 👋 Hi, I’m @LordBrim
- 👀 I used to be interested in game development and android development. Now I don't know what to do. I am now pursuing a career in web development and slowly furnishing my skills to learn A.I. and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all kinds of stuff to build my portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... web development projects and hints of A.I..
- 📫 How to reach me ... I am not yet done setting up.
